Encrypt PDF using PDFPen - Deprecated
=====================================

I am no longer using this script and haven't updated for some time. Please test thoroughly before using.

An applescript that opens a file in PDFPen and encrypts it. The file is saved in your Apple Keychain

Described how I use this file at [scrubbs.me post](http://www.scrubbs.me/my-notes-blog/2012/12/16/update-to-automatically-encrypting-pdf-with-pdfpen-via-applescript-and-hazel)
